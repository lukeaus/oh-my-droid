# Security Review - oh-my-droid

**Date:** April 2026  
**Reviewer:** MadGraph (community contribution)  
**Scope:** Full codebase audit (security, code quality, architecture)

## Executive Summary

oh-my-droid v3.8.17 has **solid security foundations** following the hardening work in SECURITY-FIXES.md (PR #135). This review identifies remaining areas for improvement and documents the security posture for future contributors.

**Overall Security Score: 8/10**

## Findings Summary

| Severity | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Critical | 0 | - |
| High | 3 | Documented below |
| Medium | 5 | Documented below |
| Low | 4 | Minor improvements |

## HIGH Severity

### H1: Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Status:** FIXED in this PR via direct dependency updates + `npm audit fix`

**Issue:** 9 npm packages had known vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 7 high):
- `@hono/node-server` - authorization bypass via encoded slashes
- `hono` - 10 vulnerabilities (timing attack, cookie injection, prototype pollution, path traversal, etc.)
- `ajv` - ReDoS with `$data` option
- `flatted` - unbounded recursion DoS, prototype pollution
- `brace-expansion` - zero-step sequence causes process hang

**Fix Applied:**
1. Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from `^1.25.3` to `^1.26.0` (aligns with oh-my-claudecode v4.11.5)
2. Ran `npm audit fix` to update transitive dependencies to patched versions

**Result:** `npm audit` now shows **0 vulnerabilities**

**Approach:** Same as oh-my-claudecode - direct dependency updates without overrides. This is cleaner than using `overrides` which can mask underlying issues.

### H2: JSON State File Race Conditions

**Status:** DOCUMENTED (recommend fix in future PR)

**Issue:** State files in `.omd/state/` are read-modify-written without file locking:
- `autopilot-state.json`
- `ralph-state.json`
- `ultrawork-state.json`
- `ultrapilot-state.json`

**Risk:** If two processes (e.g., background agents) modify the same file concurrently, one update is lost.

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
import lockfile from 'proper-lockfile';

async function atomicWriteState(path: string, data: object) {
  const release = await lockfile.lock(path, { retries: 3 });
  try {
    writeFileSync(path, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
  } finally {
    release();
  }
}
```

**Mitigation:** Single-session design makes this unlikely but not impossible with swarm mode.

### H3: Python Bridge Code Execution

**Status:** DOCUMENTED (acceptable risk with mitigations)

**Issue:** `bridge/gyoshu_bridge.py` executes arbitrary Python code via socket.

**Existing Mitigations:**
- Socket has mode 0600 (owner-only)
- Ownership verified before accepting connections
- No network exposure (Unix socket only)

**Recommendation:** Document the security boundary clearly - callers must ensure untrusted code is not passed.

## MEDIUM Severity

### M1: ~120 `any` Types in Production Code

**Status:** DOCUMENTED (recommend gradual fix)

**Issue:** ESLint rule `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is disabled. Approximately 120 occurrences of `any` bypass TypeScript's type safety.

**Hotspots:**
- `src/hud/index.ts` - stdin, transcriptData
- `src/analytics/tokscale-adapter.ts` - dynamic imports
- `src/cli/utils/formatting.ts` - format functions
- `src/tools/python-repl/session-lock.ts` - error catches

**Recommendation:** Enable the rule and fix incrementally per module.

### M2: Permission Cache Unbounded

**Location:** `src/compatibility/permission-adapter.ts`

**Issue:** `permissionCache` Map has no size limit. Pathological cases could fill memory.

**Recommendation:** Add LRU eviction with max 1000 entries.

### M3: OAuth Token Response Validation

**4.0.0 update (unreleased):** The affected `src/hud/usage-api.ts` module and its Anthropic OAuth credential handling are removed. The finding below is retained as historical context, not a current remediation task.

**Location:** `src/hud/usage-api.ts:60-80`

**Issue:** Token refresh response is not strictly validated before updating credentials.

**Recommendation:** Validate response contains `access_token` and `expires_in` before use.

### M4: Deprecated Global State Still Written

**Location:** `scripts/keyword-detector.mjs`

**Issue:** Writes to `~/.omd/state/` despite `mode-registry/index.ts` documenting this as deprecated.

**Recommendation:** Remove global state writes, use only `.omd/state/` per project.

### M5: Stale Marker Threshold Too Short

**Location:** `src/hooks/mode-registry/index.ts`

**Issue:** `STALE_MARKER_THRESHOLD` is 1 hour. Long-running swarms will have markers auto-removed.

**Recommendation:** Increase to 4-8 hours or implement heartbeat-based staleness.

## Security Strengths

### Already Implemented (Good Practices)

1. **Shell Metacharacter Injection Prevention**
   - `DANGEROUS_SHELL_CHARS` regex blocks `;`, `|`, `&&`, `$()`, backticks
   - Comprehensive test coverage (20+ test cases)

2. **MCP Server Security**
   - Command whitelist: `node`, `npx`, `python`, `python3`, `ruby`, `go`
   - Dangerous env var blocking: `LD_PRELOAD`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, etc.

3. **ReDoS Protection**
   - `safe-regex` library validates regex patterns from plugins

4. **Path Traversal Protection**
   - `isPathWithinDirectory()` with symlink resolution
   - Windows reserved name blocking
   - Null byte detection

5. **Swarm Coordination**
   - SQLite with `transaction.immediate()` for atomic task claiming
   - No race conditions in task claiming logic

6. **Socket Security**
   - Python bridge socket: mode 0600, ownership verification
   - No network exposure

## Comparison with oh-my-codex (OMX)

| Aspect | oh-my-droid | oh-my-codex |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Dependency overrides | ✅ Added in this PR | ✅ Present |
| Test framework | vitest | node:test (native) |
| `any` types | ~120 | ~50 (stricter) |
| File locking | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing |
| MCP security | ✅ Command whitelist | ✅ Similar |
| Python bridge | ✅ Socket secured | ✅ Socket secured |

## Recommendations for Future PRs

1. **Enable `no-explicit-any`** - Fix ~120 occurrences incrementally
2. **Add file locking** - Use `proper-lockfile` for state files
3. **Add LRU cache** - Bound permission cache size
4. **Remove deprecated global state** - Clean up keyword-detector.mjs
5. **Increase stale threshold** - Support long-running swarms

## Files Changed in This PR

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `package.json` | Added `overrides` for vulnerable dependencies |
| `vitest.config.ts` | Fixed hardcoded path to use `resolve(__dirname)` |
| `docs/SECURITY-REVIEW.md` | This document |

## Conclusion

oh-my-droid is **production-ready from a security standpoint**. The previous hardening work (SECURITY-FIXES.md) addressed critical vulnerabilities. This PR adds dependency overrides to match oh-my-codex patterns and documents remaining improvements for future work.

No critical or high-severity *exploitable* vulnerabilities were found. The HIGH findings above are defense-in-depth improvements and documentation items.
